Before we begin, there are some prerequisites:
##### Prequisites:
1. Make sure you have a good internet conncetion.
2. Make sure you have a device that suppost world wide web.
3. Have a rough resume on side or have knowledge what resume is before you begin to write.
4. Do some research on text editors and how they work or visit, [Top 10 Markdown editors](https://www.shopify.ca/partners/blog/10-of-the-best-markdown-editors)
* We will be using Dillinger as an example for how to use a text editor.
##### What is Dillinger?
You can briefly learn about the Dillinger in the above point as it is in the top 10 Markdown text editors. Basically, Dillinger is a text editor that supports the markdown format and is free to use. Why markdown format? In order to host your documents on GitHub, you need a markdown text editor, **Remember**?
#### How to use Dillinger:
Here is step by step guide to write down your document in markdown format in Dillinger:
1. Go to google search and write down Dillinger.io and select the very first link, or simply [click here](https://dillinger.io/)
2. At the beginning, there will be a section "DOCUMENT NAME", where you can specify the desired name of the document. We will chose index. 
3. Now, before we more forward, there are some basic information that you must know to begin writting your document as the very first step might be to give a heading or topic to the document. So, how do you implement it? Very simple, have a peak on the table shown below:

| Syntax | Use |
|---|:---:|
| # | for heading |
| ##  | for #heading but smaller text size compared to a single "#" |
| ### | for heading as well, smaller text size than "##" |
|####| you get the idea, smaller text size comapared to the prvious one, "####"|
| ** | for bold characters, i.e. **bold**|
| * |for italic cahracters, i.e *italic* |
| --- | for a line to display (at least 3 dashes) |

Now we have basic knowledge, we can write a simple document that consists of headings with different text size, bold and italic characters and a line displaying at any point.

4. Now you have written the desired document, on the top right side, there will be an option of **EXPORT AS**, click on it and chose **Markdown**.
